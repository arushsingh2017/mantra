Let’s understand this! Generally, banks/NBFCs weigh income(salary) and CIBIL as decisive factors to determine whether or not a person is eligible to secure a personal loan. Therefore, a steady salary is crucial. However, combining it with a healthy CIBIL score and low existing liabilities can help secure a better loan offer. But wait, here is a catch! @ Banks may deny financial support to low-salaried individuals even with good CIBIL. Being a salaried employee, if you don’t meet the income(salary) criterion of any lender, you may end up not getting a personal loan. However, don’t become discouraged, as a personal loan for low salary is a perfect solution for such employees.
