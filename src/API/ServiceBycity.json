Therefore, you must show any of your valuable assets or property as collateral to secure the loan amount. Valuable assets or property, such as real estate, vehicles, jewellery, savings accounts, etc., give lenders enough assurance that, if the borrower fails to repay the loan amount, the lender has the valuable collateral to recover some or all of the amount. Simply put, collateral is a token of assurance. @ From the lender’s point of view, collateral is an integral aspect of loan processing. It allows them to disburse the loan amount without much consideration for the borrower's repaying capacity. On the other hand, a lender would never like to risk his/her valuable assets/property as collateral for the sake of a loan. There are two different aspects of the same process, but the difference in their perception is like day and night. Therefore, ‘collateral-free’ is a highly preferable feature when you are eyeing to secure a loan.",
